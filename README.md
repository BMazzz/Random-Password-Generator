# Random-Password-Generator
The Random Password Generator is a very basic app that generates you a very 
strong password every time you open it up. 
the password length is always 18 characters long and
it includes upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and symbols.
This was also coded in python. I hope my app will be useful :)
